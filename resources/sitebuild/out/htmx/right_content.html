                            Danish painter. He left his small town for Denmark's capital to study drawing at the
                            Danish
                            Royal Academy; Copenhagen
                            was the centre of a spectacular resurgence of the arts. The art of the first half of the
                            19th century in Copenhagen was
                            perhaps the greatest achievement of Denmark's Golden Age. The sculptor Bertel
                            Thorvaldsen
                            and the painter Eckersberg led
                            an artistic renaissance during the Golden Age that produced, with the establishment of
                            an
                            academy in Charlottenborg in
                            1754, the artists Christen Købke, Jens Juel, Constantin Hansen, Martinus Rørbye, Johan
                            Lundbye, Wilhelm Bendz, and
                            Emanuel Larsen to name a few. The Royal Collections, what was later to become the
                            National
                            Collection after the peaceful
                            transition to a constitutional monarchy, actively supported these new artists, buying
                            these
                            'modern' pictures the moment
                            they were exhibited.</p>

                            In the face of such disasters as the overwhelming defeat of their famed navy by the
                            British
                            in 1801, the English
                            bombardment of Copenhagen in 1807 that destroyed hundreds of buildings inthe small city
                            and
                            damaged over a thousand, and
                            the declaration of national bankruptcy in 1813 and subsequent loss of Norway, Danish
                            culture
                            flourished with a willful
                            energy and a unique character. Aagaard began his career towards the end of this great
                            period
                            in Denmark but was
                            instructed by the country's great artists while at the Academy.

                            In addition to studying drawing, Aagaard assisted his older brother, a glass engraver at
                            his
                            professional studio.
                            Aagaard next apprenticed in the studio of Hilker, a painter. Aagaard collaborated with
                            Hilker on work at the University
                            and other public monuments. It was his final teacher though, the landscape painter Peter
                            Kristian Skoovgaard, that was
                            to be the most influential. In 1857 Aagaard exhibited for the first time to great
                            success.
                            He continued to exhibit and
                            trips to Switzerland and Italy helped to perfect his style.

                            In 1892 he was honoured with the title 'Professor'. He died in Copenhagen in 1895.
