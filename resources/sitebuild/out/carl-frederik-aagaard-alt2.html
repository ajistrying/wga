                        Danish painter. He left his small town for Denmark's capital to study drawing at the
                        Danish
                        Royal Academy; Copenhagen
                        was the centre of a spectacular resurgence of the arts. The art of the first half of the
                        19th century in Copenhagen was
                        perhaps the greatest achievement of Denmark's Golden Age. The sculptor Bertel
                        Thorvaldsen
                        and the painter Eckersberg led
                        an artistic renaissance during the Golden Age that produced, with the establishment of
                        an
                        academy in Charlottenborg in
                        1754, the artists Christen Købke, Jens Juel, Constantin Hansen, Martinus Rørbye, Johan
                        Lundbye, Wilhelm Bendz, and
                        Emanuel Larsen to name a few. The Royal Collections, what was later to become the
                        National
                        Collection after the peaceful
                        transition to a constitutional monarchy, actively supported these new artists, buying
                        these
                        'modern' pictures the moment
                        they were exhibited.</p>
                    <p>

                        In the face of such disasters as the overwhelming defeat of their famed navy by the
                        British
                        in 1801, the English
                        bombardment of Copenhagen in 1807 that destroyed hundreds of buildings inthe small city
                        and
                        damaged over a thousand, and
                        the declaration of national bankruptcy in 1813 and subsequent loss of Norway, Danish
                        culture
                        flourished with a willful
                        energy and a unique character. Aagaard began his career towards the end of this great
                        period
                        in Denmark but was
                        instructed by the country's great artists while at the Academy.

                        In addition to studying drawing, Aagaard assisted his older brother, a glass engraver at
                        his
                        professional studio.
                        Aagaard next apprenticed in the studio of Hilker, a painter. Aagaard collaborated with
                        Hilker on work at the University
                        and other public monuments. It was his final teacher though, the landscape painter Peter
                        Kristian Skoovgaard, that was
                        to be the most influential. In 1857 Aagaard exhibited for the first time to great
                        success.
                        He continued to exhibit and
                        trips to Switzerland and Italy helped to perfect his style.

                        In 1892 he was honoured with the title 'Professor'. He died in Copenhagen in 1895.

                                <p>This painting is unusual in 19th century art in combining landscape with still-life.
                                    In the acutely observed flowers the
                                    artist has demonstrated his skills as an observer of nature, but in the more distant
                                    landscape. The two figures,
                                    possibly lovers, are framed by the forward garland but are almost incidental to the
                                    composition.</p>
