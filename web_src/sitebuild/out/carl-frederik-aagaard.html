                                Danish painter. He left his small town for Denmark's capital to study drawing at the
                                Danish
                                Royal Academy; Copenhagen
                                was the centre of a spectacular resurgence of the arts. The art of the first half of the
                                19th century in Copenhagen was
                                perhaps the greatest achievement of Denmark's Golden Age. The sculptor Bertel
                                Thorvaldsen
                                and the painter Eckersberg led
                                an artistic renaissance during the Golden Age that produced, with the establishment of
                                an
                                academy in Charlottenborg in
                                1754, the artists Christen Købke, Jens Juel, Constantin Hansen, Martinus Rørbye, Johan
                                Lundbye, Wilhelm Bendz, and
                                Emanuel Larsen to name a few. The Royal Collections, what was later to become the
                                National
                                Collection after the peaceful
                                transition to a constitutional monarchy, actively supported these new artists, buying
                                these
                                'modern' pictures the moment
                                they were exhibited.</p>

                                In the face of such disasters as the overwhelming defeat of their famed navy by the
                                British
                                in 1801, the English
                                bombardment of Copenhagen in 1807 that destroyed hundreds of buildings inthe small city
                                and
                                damaged over a thousand, and
                                the declaration of national bankruptcy in 1813 and subsequent loss of Norway, Danish
                                culture
                                flourished with a willful
                                energy and a unique character. Aagaard began his career towards the end of this great
                                period
                                in Denmark but was
                                instructed by the country's great artists while at the Academy.

                                In addition to studying drawing, Aagaard assisted his older brother, a glass engraver at
                                his
                                professional studio.
                                Aagaard next apprenticed in the studio of Hilker, a painter. Aagaard collaborated with
                                Hilker on work at the University
                                and other public monuments. It was his final teacher though, the landscape painter Peter
                                Kristian Skoovgaard, that was
                                to be the most influential. In 1857 Aagaard exhibited for the first time to great
                                success.
                                He continued to exhibit and
                                trips to Switzerland and Italy helped to perfect his style.

                                In 1892 he was honoured with the title 'Professor'. He died in Copenhagen in 1895.
