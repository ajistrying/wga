                    Welcome to the Gallery!
                </h1>
                <p>
                    The Web Gallery of Art is a virtual museum and searchable database of European fine arts, decorative
                    arts and
                    architecture from the 3rd to 19th centuries. It was started in 1996 as a topical site of Renaissance
                    art, originated in
                    the Italian city-states of the 14th century and spread to other countries in the 15th and 16th
                    centuries. Intending to
                    present Renaissance art as comprehensively as possible, we later extended the scope of the
                    collection to
                    show its
                    Medieval roots as well as its evolution to Baroque and Rococo via Mannerism. Encouraged by the
                    feedback
                    from users, we
                    set up sections for decorative arts and architecture. Furthermore, we increased the scope of the
                    collection to include
                    Early Christian and Pre-Romanesque art and architecture of the 3rd-10th centuries. Finally, we
                    covered
                    19th-century art,
                    extended to the beginning of World War I. We do not intend to present 20th-century and contemporary
                    art.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The collection has some of the characteristics of a virtual museum. The experience of the visitors
                    is
                    enhanced by guided
                    tours helping to understand the artistic and historical relationship between different works and
                    artists, by period
                    music of choice in the background and a free postcard service. At the same time, the collection
                    serves
                    the visitors'
                    need for a site where various information on art, artists and history can be found together with
                    corresponding pictorial
                    illustrations. Although not a conventional one, the collection is a searchable database supplemented
                    by
                    a glossary
                    containing articles on art terms, relevant historical events, personages, cities, museums and
                    churches.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Web Gallery of Art is intended to be a free resource of art history primarily for students and
                    teachers. It is a
                    private initiative not related to any museums or art institutions and not supported financially by
                    any
                    state or
                    corporate sponsors. However, we do our utmost, use authentic literature and advice from
                    professionals to
                    ensure the
                    quality and authenticity of the content.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are convinced that such a collection of digital reproductions, containing a balanced mixture of
                    interlinked visual
                    and textual information, can serve multiple purposes. On the one hand, it can simply be a source of
                    artistic enjoyment,
                    a convenient alternative to visiting a distant museum, or an incentive to do just that. On the other
                    hand, it can serve
                    as a tool for public education both in schools and at home.
