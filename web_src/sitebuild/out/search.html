                Welcome to the Gallery!
            </h1>
            <p>
                The Web Gallery of Art is a virtual museum and searchable database of European fine arts, decorative
                arts and
                architecture from the 3rd to 19th centuries. It was started in 1996 as a topical site of Renaissance
                art, originated in
                the Italian city-states of the 14th century and spread to other countries in the 15th and 16th
                centuries. Intending to
                present Renaissance art as comprehensively as possible, we later extended the scope of the collection to
                show its
                Medieval roots as well as its evolution to Baroque and Rococo via Mannerism. Encouraged by the feedback
                from users, we
                set up sections for decorative arts and architecture. Furthermore, we increased the scope of the
                collection to include
                Early Christian and Pre-Romanesque art and architecture of the 3rd-10th centuries. Finally, we covered
                19th-century art,
                extended to the beginning of World War I. We do not intend to present 20th-century and contemporary art.
            </p>
            <p>
                The collection has some of the characteristics of a virtual museum. The experience of the visitors is
                enhanced by guided
                tours helping to understand the artistic and historical relationship between different works and
                artists, by period
                music of choice in the background and a free postcard service. At the same time, the collection serves
                the visitors'
                need for a site where various information on art, artists and history can be found together with
                corresponding pictorial
                illustrations. Although not a conventional one, the collection is a searchable database supplemented by
                a glossary
                containing articles on art terms, relevant historical events, personages, cities, museums and churches.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Web Gallery of Art is intended to be a free resource of art history primarily for students and
                teachers. It is a
                private initiative not related to any museums or art institutions and not supported financially by any
                state or
                corporate sponsors. However, we do our utmost, use authentic literature and advice from professionals to
                ensure the
                quality and authenticity of the content.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are convinced that such a collection of digital reproductions, containing a balanced mixture of
                interlinked visual
                and textual information, can serve multiple purposes. On the one hand, it can simply be a source of
                artistic enjoyment,
                a convenient alternative to visiting a distant museum, or an incentive to do just that. On the other
                hand, it can serve
                as a tool for public education both in schools and at home.
